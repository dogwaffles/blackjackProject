> -Developed a class for card, with a function to display string data indicating suit (ascii graphic) and card face. It's unfinished, but debugged and cleaned up. I still havve to add a dictionary-type object with the card names and values, as well as a way to produce a full deck as an array.\
> -I also installed VS Code and got git pushes working from console.\
> -Implemented a big fix in the card printer (faulty logic in comparison operators). Cleaned up comments. Reorganized README.

    Project Title: Louis Reilly's Blackjack Trainer
    Objective: Its basic functionality is to realistically simulate games of blackjack, using random.seed(x) and random.random() for deal behavior.
        It will feature full casino rules, including dealer behavior (which is programmatic), and player (H)it (S)tand (D)ouble and (S)plit.
        It will have several difficulty parameters including (number of decks) and (% of cards removed from dealer stack)
        It will also keep track of player statistics, creating a user file based on name entered by user input
        This will be useful for blackjack practice - keeping track of win/loss statistics is helpful in improving one's game.
    Key Features: Outline how you plan to use:
        Variables Class variables will be imported, including user_name, user_hand, dealer_hand, win/loss(current_session), win/loss(all_time), etc.
        Functions shuffling, dealing, player actions, exporting to user data file
        If/Else statements dealer behavior (hit/stand) is programmatic. There is also dynamic actions based on user's current hand. (Split, 5-card, Ace value,...)
        Loops Shuffling, dealing, player action, updating output data
    “One New Thing”: initially I will import class definitions to keep things clean, and use Pandas to create data tables
        As "extras" - programmatic player behavior (user defined bot behavior), dynamic player behavior ("AI" bot behavior), a GUI, just graphics, multi-player, etc.
    Plan: Daily programming session, one hour first thing in the morning, one in the afternoon after a short nap. 
        One week for basic program functionality (including classes and Pandas data tables)
        One week for 'extras' (bot plays, graphics, etc.)
    Team or Individual: Individual
    *Please note that while blackjack is not the most moral of pursuits, it can be an enjoyable diversion that is winnable with skill and presence. I understand that any gambling game can be problematic, so
